> The right building blocks can supercharge efforts to solve problems at scale. 

This was the belief that brought Tej and Jay together in late 2015 to launch what was then Jaaga Sustain - an effort to support fledgling environmental startups in India. Sustain eventually became Jaaga Labs and was spun off as IoTReady in early 2018. And here we are - growing, consolidating and continuing to empower our customers through the weirdest year of our lifetimes!
