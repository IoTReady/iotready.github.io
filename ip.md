The roots of the company go back to IP driven hardware development leading to the development and sale of [4 patents](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search?q=tej%20pochiraju). Today, we have significant strengths in software too with a strong foundation in [open source](/open-source/). 

We retain strategic IP in core areas of expertise, typically hardware. We will continue to update the table below as we build new things.
