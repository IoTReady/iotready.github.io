## Problem Statement
LTV wanted to build out internal IoT capabilities to add to their strengths in designing and manufacturing consumer light therapy products.

## Solution

![Qure App Animation](/images/qure_animation.gif)

We have been working closely the LTV team through a combination of building blocks and mentoring. The code kits cover firmware for BLE and WiFi chipsets, apps for Android and iOS and scripts for data parsing. With hands-on mentoring, code reviews and architectural advice, we have been able to help LTV ship multiple IoT enabled products and build internal systems.  

### Challenges

- SDKs and policies for Android and iOS change very often and app approvals, sometimes, feel whimsical. We ensure our code kits keep up with the tides! 
- Good code frameworks can unlock significant potential from even inexperienced developers. But these frameworks are hard to come by, especially for firmware. This triggered the launch of our [Docs](https://iotready.github.io/docs/).
