## Customer - [Datamars](https://datamars.com/)

> We believe information is the way to a better, more sustainable world.

## Problem Statement
Datamars, one of the world's largest RFID manufacturers, needed a smaller, more robust tag that sheep would not rip off on fences!

## Solution

We sold two patents and designs to Datamars for miniature UHF antennas that measured less than 20mm x 4mm and can be made with standard FR4 substrates. All this, while still achieving 3m+ range on animal.

### Challenges

- The most common challenge with wearable tags is the antenna detuning caused by muscle and fat. We designed our antenna to take *advantage* of these effects.
- The impedance of standard RFID ICs throws off Electromagnetic Simulation softwares. We developed our own recalibration routine with data from over 50 designs!
