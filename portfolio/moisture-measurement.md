## Problem Statement
Tovalia were developing a new version of their moisture sensor, specifically for meat products. These needed a high gain, wideband UWB antenna to work with their proprietary RF hardware. Additionally, the antenna needed to be small to fit the constraints of their product.

## Solution

![Venal Feed](/images/venal_feed.png)

Neither commercial off-the-shelf antennas nor any of the antennas from standard design libraries were a good fit for the use case. We modified and shipped antennas from our IP library and mentored the team through calibration of their test setup.


### Challenges

- Antenna design can be challenging when numerous, conflicting constraints are imposed. However, given our experience and expertise, we were able to pick a design that checked all the boxes.
- The team being supported had limited RF experience giving us another opportunity to help train and upskill a customer team.
