## Customer - [REPL](https://www.repl.com/)

> One of the leading manufacturers of cable accessories for power and telecom industries across the globe.

## Problem Statement
REPL wanted to develop a self-powered, remote comms enabled version of their medium voltage (MV) smart termination while lowering the costs to allow larger scale rollouts.

## Solution
![Smart Termination Sensor](/images/smart_termination.jpg)

We combined off-the-shelf sensor components with a cleverly engineered energy-harvesting circuitry to build a self-powered current and temperature sensor with modular BLE/GPRS/Modbus communication interfaces. This IP is now the basis for the next generation REPL smart terminations.

### Challenges
- Terminations have a lifetime of 10 year or more. Careful combination of lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors allows us to achieve this lifetime. 
- We scouted the world to build a robust supply chain keeping quality and costs in mind and found a key supplier in our backyard!
- Achieving Class 1 (1%) accuracy needed lots of expert tuning of the sensing circuit and the ADC firmware.
